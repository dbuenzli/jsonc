(** JSON data description and codecs.

    [Jsont] describes JSON data structures with
    {{!base_descr}combinators}. The resulting typed descriptions
    enable JSON backend codecs to {{!enc}encode} and {{!dec}decode}
    these structures from/to OCaml values.

    Consult the {{!basics}basics} and {{!limits}limitations}.

    {e Release %%VERSION%% â€” %%MAINTAINER%% } *)

(** {1:value_codecs Value codecs}

    Value codec allow to refine JSON value descriptions to more
    appopriate OCaml types and hook into [Jsont]'s error reporting
    mecanism. This allows, for example, to parse a JSON string value
    into an URI, a JSON object into a record, etc.  *)

(** The type for value decoders.  *)

(** The type for value codecs.  *)

(** {1:locations Value location} *)

    repsectively one and zero based. *)

    {!object_values} for using values of this type. *)

(** {1:base_descr JSON base value descriptions} *)

type 'a descr
(** The type for JSON value descriptions. A value of this type
    describes a JSON value structure and knows how to codec it to an
    OCaml value of type ['a].

    All value descriptions have a {!default} value of type ['a]. This
    value is used either as a placeholder in case of error during
